# MasterMindGo

Go code that makes optimal guesses in the [MasterMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29) game by choosing the guess that maximizes [information entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)). Uses multithreading to speed up the calculation. Compile and run the file `mastermind.go` to first run a benchmark and then let the computer guess the color combination you thought of.
